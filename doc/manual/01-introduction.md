##Introduction

LuaNotify is a library that helps to implement the observer/observed pattern, enabling event emission/reception with the idea of hierarchical events.

It is inspired on many libraries that do event dispatching, like py-notify, GSignals, QT event system, wxWidgets event system, etc.

Besides the reference documentation and some examples, the best documentation to this library are its tests ;-).

Have fun :D.

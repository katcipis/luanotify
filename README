README / LuaNotify is a Lua package providing tools for implementing observer programming pattern
=============================================================

Introduction
------------
LuaNotify is inspired on many libraries that do event dispatching, like
py-notify, GSignals, QT event system, wxWidgets event system, etc. 
But we tried to do something different that can make use of Lua resources 
and to be more Lua-ish as possible. 

Quick start
-----------
Just copy the *.lua files to your project directory and use it or 
copy it to the Lua default module search path so Lua can find it.
